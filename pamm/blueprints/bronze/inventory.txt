# Ansible inventory for the BRONZE level PAMM blueprint
#
# NOTE:
#   This blueprint is meant for deployment ONLY on Virtual Machines using the SSH connection plugin.
#   For development purposes, Privileged Docker Containers are used to simulate virtual machine targets in a linux
#   environment using the Docker connection plugin.
#
#   So that it is possible to use docker and ssh interchangeably, this inventory does not contain information
#   on which roles are deployed to which hosts, only host and variable definitions.
#   The mapping between roles and hosts is done in the main playbook file.

#   a) docker - for Docker containers - used to test the build scripts
#   b) vm     - for actual VM: enter ip address below and when running up.sh will need to add -k to prompt for password
#   c) ec2    - for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) - set EC2 variables below
#
tgt_platform=docker

# For vm target platform, enter its IP address below:
