## Container Settings

The `container_settings.json` file is used by IntelliJ when starting the CI Docker container.  It was generated by IntelliJ by entering `-d -p 80:80 -p 3306:3306` into the **Parse CLI to JSON** window which is available on the Container tab in the Docker Run/Debug configuration window.
