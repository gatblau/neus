# NEUS Project

The NEUS project is an environment automation library aimed at defining, standardising and automating the deployment of software services on both Virtual Machine and Linux Container infrastructure.

- [PAMM](pamm/readme.md): provides the automation scripts to deploy different  environments to run applications built on the PAMM stack for web development (Play/AngularJS/MariaDB/MongoDB).
- [JAMM](jamm/readme.md): provides the automation scripts to deploy different  environments to run applications built on the JAMM stack for enterprise integration (JBoss Fuse/ActiveMQ/MariaDB/MongoDB).
