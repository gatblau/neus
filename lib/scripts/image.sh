# Builds a docker image if it is not in the local docker registry
# Usage:
#    build_image $1 $2
#      where:
#        $1 : relative directory where the docker file to build the image is located
#        $2 : image repository
#        $3 : image tag
#    e.g.: build_image ../lib/images/centos7d gatblau.org centos7d
