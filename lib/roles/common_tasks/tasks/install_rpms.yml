#  This playbook uses a loop to copy rpms to the managed node.
#  For this to work, this playbook must be called using a loop control
#  variable called "package".  See example below:
#
#  - include_tasks: "plays/install_rpms.yml"
#    with_dict: "{{ package_dictionary }}"
#    loop_control:
#      loop_var: package
#
#  dictionary variable package_dictionary is structured as follows:
#
#  <app_packages>:
#    <app_name>:
#      packages:
#        - package1.rpm
#        - package2.rpm
#        - package3.rpm
#
