## CI Docker Image

This folder contains the files to create a CI Bronze Docker image.  Note: the centos7-sysd Docker image must be created before building the CI Docker container.  See the [readme](../../centos7-sysd/readme.md) for details.


## IntelliJ Idea

The following details how to build the Docker CI Bronze image using IntelliJ Idea 15 using the Europa VM (which can be found [here](http://github.com/gatblau/europa)).  For Docker Support in IntelliJ Idea, click [here](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2015/03/docker-support-in-intellij-idea-14-1/).

First, download and install the following plugins (IntelliJ will need to be restarted):
 
- **Docker integration** (select *JetBrains plugin*)
 
- **BashSupport** (select *Browse repositories*)


### Docker Connection

Open a terminal and run the following command: `sudo chmod 0666 /var/run/docker.sock` to allow access to the Docker socket.  

If using Europa then place this command in .bash_profile so that it is run each login as the permissions are reset when Europa is restarted.

**Using IntelliJ Idea:**

Select File -> Settings

Search for Clouds, click the + sign, add new Docker deployment and set the following:

- Name:    Docker
- API URL: unix:///var/run/docker.sock


### Build Docker Image

Using IntelliJ Idea:

Right click on `build.sh` and select **Run 'build.sh'**.  This will download installation files and build the CI Docker image.


### Docker Container Settings

Using IntelliJ Idea:

Open the **Application Servers** window, right click on the cidocker Docker image and select **Create Container** then **create**.

Enter a name for the container, e.g. **cidocker**.

Select the **Container** tab and enter the following:

- Select the JSON file using the following path:  `neus/plays/blueprints/ci_env/docker/docker-settings/container_settings.json`.
- Set the **Entrypoint** to `/usr/startup.sh`.

Click on **Apply** then **Run**.  The cidocker container will start.  Right click the container and click **Inspect** to see its details.  Find the **IPAddress** and enter this into a browser window followed by **/jenkins**.  Once the Jenkins dashboard is displayed (the browser window may need to be refreshed several times and may display a 502 error) login using the jenkins user (password is jenkins).

Before using Jenkins the installed plugins should be checked and updated if neccessary.  Select **Manage Jenkins** followed by **Manage Plugins**, scroll down select **All** then click on **Download now and install after restart**.  Click the **restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running** check box.  Once Jenkins has restarted, login again and run the **Smoke Test** build job.  The build job polls the GOGS repository for changes every 15 minutes and may have already run.  Once the plugins are updated, the smoke test should run and build successfully.  The CI environment is now ready to use.
