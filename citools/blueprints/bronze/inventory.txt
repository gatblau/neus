# Ansible inventory for the BRONZE level CI Tools blueprint
#
# NOTE:
#   This blueprint is meant for deployment ONLY on Virtual Machines using the SSH connection plugin.
#   For development purposes, Privileged Docker Containers are used to simulate virtual machine targets in a linux
#   environment using the Docker connection plugin.
#
#   So that it is possible to use docker and ssh interchangeably, this inventory does not contain information
#   on which roles are deployed to which hosts, only host and variable definitions.
#   The mapping between roles and hosts is done in the main playbook file.
