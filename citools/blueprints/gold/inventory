# Manages the execution of roles on a docker container.
# The only part of this playbook that needs changing is the list of roles as described below.
# The name of the playbook should be updated to reflect the host name - e.g. database.yml
#

#
# Ansible inventory for the gold-level CI Tools blueprint
#
# To provision to Virtual Machines change the following variables:
#  - become: determines if sudo is used
#  - connection: determines the connection plugin to be used (e.g. docker or ssh)
#  - ansible_ssh_port: the ssh port to use if connection is set to 'ssh'
#  - ansible_ssh_host: the IP address of the Virtual Machines to provision if connection is set to 'ssh'
#
# NOTE: so that it is possible to use docker and ssh interchangeably, this inventory does not contain information
#   on which roles are deployed to which hosts, only host and variable definitions.
#   The mapping between roles and hosts is done in the main playbook file.
