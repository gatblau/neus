# JAMM Application Environments

This solution presents various different topologies of environments (blueprints) to deploy a JAMM application. 
The blueprints can be automatically deployed on Virtual Machine infrastructure (bronze to platinum) or Container Management Infrastructure (silicon).

Currently the JAMM basic blueprint is available with JBoss Fuse Fabric and MariaDB on a single host.
