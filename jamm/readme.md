# JAMM Application Environments

This solution presents various different topologies of environments (blueprints) to deploy a JAMM application. 
The blueprints can be automatically deployed on Virtual Machine infrastructure (bronze to platinum) or Container Management Infrastructure (silicon).

The JAMM bliueprints are to be implemented.
